      \"Invitation Au Voyage: II\". Do you know that poem of Baudelaire's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q501]?\
      \ It's something at the end of the world. He\u2019s speaking to his beloved,\
      \ very simple. You know, lots of the German Romanticism was very simple.\n \n\
      John Wieners\n00:01:30\nReads \"Invitation Au Voyage: II\".\n \nJohn Wieners\n\
      00:03:15\nWell let's go back to the old poems then, that have been published.\
      \ Stuart Montgomery, well it doesn't matter. But that--I can send it off to\
      \ England [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21] to the Fulcrum Press [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5507820]\
      \ doing a lot of Basil Bunting [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2886803] and\
      \ the English poet of 65, resuscitated in America [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30]\
      \ again, it's about time.\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:03:44\nReads \"Long Nook\" [from\

      \"The Pool of Light\".\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:05:53\nReads \"The Pool of Light\"\

      , forgive me for this, I thought the other poems would carry me through, but\
      \ I'm reading and keeping with the mood for tonight, it seems to be more lyrical.\
      \ \"The Serpent's Hiss\".\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:07:52\nReads \"The Serpent's\
      \ Hiss\" [published later in Selected Poems, 1958-1984].\n \nJohn Wieners\n\
      00:08:37\nAnd this is called \"Tuesday, 5 pm\".\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:08:43\n\
      Reads \"Tuesday, 5 pm\" [published later as \u201CTuesday 7:00 PM\u201D in Selected\
      \ Poems, 1958-1984].\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:10:45\nI'm going to read the \"The\
      \ Imperatrice\". Ace of Pentacles is a card in the Tarot deck, but the book\
      \ should be called \u2018pente\u2019 which all the words that appeared in a\
      \ hypnagogic vision, hypnagogic is the state between waking and sleeping, it's\
      \ what Jung [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41532] practiced and his Marie Louise\
      \ Franz would take down the things that came to him in the state between waking\
      \ and sleeping and the letters \u2018pente\u2019 appeared in that state and\
      \ I didn't know what they meant so I kept hunting around and I made the word\
      \ 'pinnacles' out of it and somebody said why don't you call it \"Ace of Pinnacles\"\
      \ and we made a whole thing about the Tarot deck, but that's not the title of\
      \ the book. It should be \u2018pente\u2019 and that's from the Greek  which\
      \ is \u2018wall\u2019. And I'd like have as a fronts piece for the book William\
      \ Blake's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41513] \"The Chimney Sweep\"  [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2587725]\
      \ the second version of that from the \"Songs of Experience\" [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q27890603]\
      \ when he says that my mum and father have gone up to the church to pray and\
      \ they make a heaven of my misery. That kind of thing. Imperatrice there's another\
      \ card from the Tarot deck it's the third card of the deck.\n \nJohn Wieners\n\
      00:12:09\nReads \"The Imperatrice\" [published later in Selected Poems, 1958-1984].\n\
      \ \nJohn Wieners\n00:13:38\nThere is something else I thought I'd like to read\
      \ after that one. I'll read a poem for Sylvia Plath [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q133054]\
      \ who was an American poet who married an English man, Ted Hughes [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q272194]\
      \ and had mental troubles and wrote a novel about it called The Bell Jar [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1213085]\
      \ under a pseudonym Victoria Lucas, so not to embarrass her mother, and then\
      \ things became too much for her and I think in 1963, she did away with herself\
      \ in London [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q84], and it was a great loss, some\
      \ people feel that and some do not, they feel that at least--Lowell has written\
      \ an introduction to her poems posthumously printed called Ariel [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q224733]\
      \ and her first book was The Colossus [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q29889462].\
      \ But Victoria Lucas was, The Bell Jar, was, you could buy it through William\
      \ Hiderman and it came down from Canada [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16]\
      \ to the United States and it's never been printed in the country. This is \"\
      The Suicide\".\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:15:06\nReads \"The Suicide\" [published\
      \ later in Selected Poems, 1958-1984].\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:16:57\nLet's read\
      \ some happy poems, I'm getting depressed.\n\nUnknown\n00:17:03\n[Cut or edit\
      \ made in tape].\n\nJohn Wieners\n00:17:04\nReads \"Ode on a Common Fountain\"\
      \ [from Ace of Pentacles; recording jumps to mid-poem].\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:19:51\n\
      That's the first poem, I ever, I was twenty, so that was twelve years ago, that\
      \ poem was written. Now I can go back--I'm still writing about Acis [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q419156]\
      \ and Galatea [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q241070] but these are terribly\
      \ sentimental and distraught, drunken poems, you can call them. Maybe we'll\
      \ have one more, or is that anything from that first reading that you'd like\
      \ to hear again? I'd rather not go into it. [Unknown audience member suggests\
      \ poem. Title unintelligible]. Okay, that's what Spender [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q448764]\
      \ did say to me, he said you look like a de-frocked priest, so. Which I thought\
      \ was awfully cruel, but I think I am one, my sister was a nun, I'll be a priest.\
      \ Poets are priests, you know.\n \nJohn Wieners\n00:20:54\nReads \u201CThere\
      \ are holy orders in life...\u201D [published later in Selected Poems, 1958-1984].\n\

    name: Wieners, John
    notes: " American poet, playwright and essayist John Wieners was born in Boston\
      \ on January 6, 1934. In 1934, Wieners earned a B.A. in English from Boston\
      \ College, and subsequently worked at Harvard University\u2019s Lamont Library.\
      \ A 1955 poetry reading by Charles Olson inspired Wieners to attend Black Mountain\
      \ College in North Carolina, where he met and was mentored by Charles Olson\
      \ and Robert Duncan. After completing studies in 1956, John Wieners moved back\
      \ to Boston and started Measure, a (short-lived) literary magazine, as well\
      \ as becoming involved in the Poet\u2019s Theater in Cambridge. At the age of\
      \ 24, (in 1958) Wieners moved to San Francisco and met Beat Poets Jack Kerouac,\
      \ Jack Spicer and Allen Ginsberg, and published his first book of poems, The\
      \ Hotel Wentley Poems (Dave Haselwood Publishing, 1965). John Wieners\u2019\
      \ San Francisco journal, The Journal of John Wieners Is To Be Called 707 Scott\
      \ Street for Billie Holiday, 1959, was published in 1966 by Sun & Moon Press.\
      \ Wieners wrote plays that were never published during this time, until 1964\
      \ when he published Ace of Pentacles (published by James F. Carr & Robert A.\
      \ Wilson). Charles Olson asked Wieners to be a graduate student and a teaching\
      \ assistant at the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1965, and Wieners\
      \ eventually became the university\u2019s chair of poetics, when he left by\
      \ 1967. John Wieners suffered from mental illness, and was institutionalized\
      \ for the second time in 1969, where he wrote Asylum Poems (For My Father) (Press\
      \ of the Black Flag Raised). In 1970, he published Nerves (Cape Goliard Press),\
      \ an internationally published book of poetry, and between 1967 to 1972, he\
      \ published six smaller books of poetry. Behind the State Capitol; or, Cincinnati\
      \ Pike (Good Gay Poets Press) was published in 1975 and thus marked the last\
      \ of his published poems. John Wieners\u2019 poetry, while highly appraised\
      \ by Beat Poets, Black Mountain Poets and his peers, did not achieve wide public\
      \ acclaim or readership. In 1985, however, Selected Poems, 1958-1984 (Black\
      \ Sparrow Press) was compiled with the help of Robert Creeley and Allen Ginsberg.\
      \ In the 70\u2019s, John Wieners lived and became involved with anti-war movements\
      \ and became an activist for gay rights, living at 44 Joy Street in Boston.\
      \ Becoming more and more reclusive after the mid 70\u2019s, John Wieners died\
      \ of an apparent stroke on March 1, 2002. Michael Carr edited a posthumous collection\
      \ of Wiener\u2019s 1971 journals which was published in 2007."

      \ problem that we have here at Sir George [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q326342].\
      \ We did try to get a larger hall but it was impossible. To accommodate the\
      \ overflow, we have set up loudspeakers in the little gallery here, Howard,\
      \ and in the other one too?\n \nHoward Fink\n00:00:21\nOutside.\n \nHenry Beissel\n\
      00:00:22\nOutside, there are loudspeakers. So please don't all crowd into the\
      \ room. If you are going to lean against the paintings, we shall never be able\
      \ to get this room again for poetry readings. Because this, this is a gallery\
      \ which belongs to the Fine Arts department, we had great difficulty getting\
      \ it, these paintings are very precious, particularly to the artists themselves\
      \ [audience laughter]. I would ask you please to stay away from the paintings.\
      \ That must have been the artist [audience laughter]. We are also waiting for\
      \ the arrival of someone else, so please be patient. Howard--[audience laughter]\
      \ can you ask the security people to turn on the cooling system, the hall is\
      \ going to be too hot.\n \nUnknown\n00:01:22\nAmbient Sound [voices].\n \nHenry\
      \ Beissel\n00:01:25\nWe may get 927.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:01:30\nWhat do\
      \ you mean, we may, I think they're also--okay. What would you like to do? Let\
      \ us stay here or move?\n \nAudience\n00:01:41\nStay here.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n\
      00:01:44\nOkay, with the people, there are some people who are at the back of\
      \ the door, there is some space up here at the front if you'd like to come up.\n\
      \ \nHenry Beissel\n00:01:54\nNo more than ten.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:01:58\n\
      About ten. It'll make more room at the back too...If everybody on the chairs\
      \ would shift over this way, um, and sit on, sort of as if it were a bench,\
      \ then some more people can sit on the edges there. Or just move the chairs\
      \ all that way. Move the rows forward. They're all shifting over anyway. Could\
      \ you all move your chairs forward to make the rows as close together as possible.\
      \ Okay, it's alright. \n\nUnknown\n00:03:17\nAmbient Sound [voices].\n\nMargaret\
      \ Atwood\n00:04:41\nThere are these uhh--woohoo--there are these speakers outside\
      \ and you might be more comfortable if you went out and listened over the speakers,\
      \ some of the people are really jammed in there. I don't see any reason why\
      \ this thing should resemble a steam bath, for all of us. If you're--what? what?...I\
      \ don't think I can, what is it that they do? [Audience laughter].\n \nWynne\
      \ Francis\n00:05:19\n[Laughter]. Miss Atwood [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q183492]\
      \ has just upstaged the introducer. Good evening ladies and gentlemen. It's\
      \ not often that an artist excels in two medium such as poetry and fiction as\
      \ our guest tonight does. Miss Atwood's reputation as a superior poet was established\
      \ in the 60's with her first collections, The Circle Game [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7723073]\
      \ and The Animals in that Country [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7713834].\
      \ And while continuing to write fine poetry, six major collections to date,\
      \ she's given  us two novels in the last five years, The Edible Woman [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7731579]\
      \ and Surfacing. With the second novel, published late in 1972, within a few\
      \ months of a controversial work of criticism, Margaret Atwood became one of\
      \ Canada's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16] best known literary artists.\
      \ The hypothesis of Survival, a study of patterns in Canadian lit is that Canadians\
      \ see themselves as victims. I was remind of Survival recently when I came across\
      \ a nineteenth-century curiosity written by one John McTaggart [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q463553].\
      \ It was a book published in London [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q84] in 19--\
      \ excuse me--1829. McTaggart wrote \"There's a melancholy which is peculiar\
      \ to Canadians which must be combatted. People who labor under it must be encouraged,\
      \ the soothing language, good treatment and now and then as circumstances require,\
      \ a little assistance gratis as a stimulant.\" McTaggart's third point about\
      \ the helpful effects of a little assistance as a recent theory has been taken\
      \ up by the Canada Council [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2993809], to whom\
      \ we are in part indebted for her appearance tonight. Margaret Atwood's work\
      \ constitutes an exploration of what it means to be a Canadian, to be a woman\
      \ and to be a human being. She writes about our totems, our tapestry of manners,\
      \ our progressive insanities. She taught at Sir George in 67-68, and it's a\
      \ great pleasure to have her return to us tonight. After her reading, she'll\
      \ be open to questions from the audience. Ladies and gentlemen, Margaret Atwood.\n\
      \nAudience\n00:07:27\nApplause [cuts out briefly].\n\nMargaret Atwood\n00:07:38\n\
      Let's see now, if the mic starts to get funny, let me know...Too loud?...Not\
      \ too loud, I'm afraid it isn't a very good mic and also I'm afraid I'm going\
      \ to have to hold it the whole time which is a bore...I don't think it'll work\
      \ very well, is that better? Does that work? Higher? Lower? Okay, how's that?\
      \ Okay, I'm going to read entirely from my new book which is called \"This is\"\
      --oh, what is it called? [audience laughter]. It's called You Are Happy. Somebody\
      \ who has been photographing me says that a friend of hers was in a bookstore\
      \ and picked out this book and thought at first that this was one of these \"\
      I'm Okay, You're Okay\" books. Until I saw who wrote it. [Audience laughter].\
      \ But it has a happy ending, you'll be pleased to know. And I'm going to begin\
      \ at the beginning and end at the end. Skipping portions along the way. I'm\
      \ also going to make this reading fairly short because we are all in this rather\
      \ constricted situation. I used to tell people when people in the States [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30]\
      \ used to ask me \u201Cdo you live in an igloo\u201D and other questions like\
      \ that, I used to think to myself that being a Canadian was sort of like living\
      \ in a chicken coop in the middle of the desert. That everybody was all together\
      \ in one place but there are these huge spaces around. I wish that  we had been\
      \ provided with one of them. [Audience laughter]. I have a chicken coop, and\
      \ you're nicer. But there are more of you. I think we will all have to be very,\
      \ very patient, unlike the chickens. I'm going to begin by reading a poem called\
      \ \"Newsreel: Man and Firing Squad\".\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:10:04\nReads \"\
      Newsreel: Man and Firing Squad\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:11:42\n\
      Reads \"Useless\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:12:35\nThis is--the\
      \ image in this next poem comes from, begins with the fact that I have a sheep\
      \ and one of them died. The poem is called \"November\".\n \nMargaret Atwood\n\
      00:12:48\nReads \"November\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:13:52\n\
      Reads \"Repent\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:14:47\n\"Tricks\
      \ with Mirrors\". How are you doing? Is it hot and steamy? Has anybody died\
      \ yet?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:15:05\nReads \"Tricks with Mirrors\" from You\
      \ Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:17:45\nThis is the title poem, \"You Are\
      \ Happy\".\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:17:50\nReads \"You are Happy\" from You Are\
      \ Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:18:48\nReads \"First Prayer\" from You Are\
      \ Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:20:25\n\"Is / Not: 1\". Oh boy, is it ever\
      \ hot in here. I can't stand it. Light. I wonder if we could--well, then I can't\
      \ see, you see. I wonder if we could turn off--would it be better if we turn\
      \ off those lights that are grilling you over there...I could what?...Where's\
      \ the light switch anyway? Howard, turn off the lights?...Well, maybe in a few\
      \ minutes the lights will go off. Where did\u2026\n\nUnknown\n00:21:36\n[Cut\
      \ or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed]. \n\nMargaret Atwood\n\
      00:21:37\nHooray, wonderful. Actually, there's a light under here. It's like\
      \ the Saturday movies [audience laughter]. No, I can read with this, yeah. Maybe\
      \ I'll just read a little something else here, because it's the Saturday Movies.\n\
      \ \nMargaret Atwood\n00:22:18\nReads [\"You take my hand\" from Power Politics;\
      \ audience laughter throughout].\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:23:13\nAnd since we\
      \ were talking about the war between Superman [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79015]\
      \ and Captain Marvel [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q534153] at dinner, my favourite\
      \ was Plastic Man [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q746838], but that was an esoteric\
      \ taste. I'll read this one.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:23:28\nReads \"They Eat\
      \ Out\" [from Power Politics].\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:24:44\nI go to--I can't\
      \ resist this. This is from the new book, it's called \"Siren Song\". Students\
      \ of Seventeenth Century Literature are always asking themselves and each other,\
      \ what song the sirens sang, and this is the ultimate answer.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n\
      00:25:06\nReads \"Siren Song\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:26:12\n\
      The imminent critic, Allen Pearson, who was once known when he lived in Montreal\
      \ [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q340] as the Montreal Poet, now that he lives\
      \ in Toronto [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q172], he's probably known as the\
      \ Toronto Poet, says the following: \"Siren Song tells how boring it is for\
      \ a woman to be obliged to attract men by appealing to them for help\". [Audience\
      \ laughter]. Um, since I'm on the subject of people in capes and costumes, I'll\
      \ read...\n \nUnknown\n00:26:56\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of\
      \ time elapsed].\n\nAnnotation\n00:26:57\nReads [untitled poem from the \u201C\
      Circle/Mud Poems\u201D section in You Are Happy].\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:28:20\n\
      Reads \"Is / Not\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:30:37\nI think\
      \ I'd better read just three more poems, before we all die. The first one is\
      \ called \"There is Only One of Everything\".\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:30:54\n\
      Reads \"There is Only One of Everything\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n\
      00:32:30\nReads \"Late August\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:33:26\n\
      This is the last poem, called \"Book of Ancestors\".\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:33:33\n\
      Reads \"Book of Ancestors\" from You Are Happy. \n \nAudience\n00:36:31\nApplause\
      \ [cuts out briefly].\n\nWynne Francis\n00:36:47\nThank you, it's really not\
      \ so hot if you sit still. Miss Atwood is prepared to discuss, for a little\
      \ while.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:37:04\nIf you would like to, uh, I can't see\
      \ a thing of course, I can sort of see hands if you stick them up and wave them\
      \ around. Would that be better than turning back on the lights which I'd prefer\
      \ not to do?\n \nWynne Francis\n00:37:22\nThere's no way we can get mics in\
      \ the audience, so please speak loudly.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:37:23\nI see\
      \ a hand.\n \nAudience Member 1\n00:37:28\nHow did your nickname of a witch\
      \ get originated?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:37:30\nHow did my nickname of a witch?\
      \ Are you referring to the speech I gave the other night at Loyola? Oh, it's,\
      \ I was talking about a couple of reviews, that seemed to credit me with having\
      \ these supernatural powers, you know, the ability to hypnotize my readers and\
      \ things like that, and what I was saying was that in fact I don't in fact possess\
      \ the powers of hypnotism or I'd use them on my bank manager and be quite rich.\
      \ Um, I was talking about a pattern that seems to crop up from time to time\
      \ in a certain kind of review usually written by men. [Audience laughter]. I\
      \ heard that there were a couple of people in the audience at Loyola who before\
      \ the speech, were convinced that I was a witch and that I was going to talk\
      \ about witchcraft, and when I said that I wasn't one, they left. [Audience\
      \ laughter]. You see, if I were a witch, I wouldn't be able to wear the cross.\
      \ So that's how you can tell I'm not. Wards off vampires. Um, yes?\n \nAudience\
      \ Member 2\n00:38:54\nUm, [unintelligible] and as well as the Edible Woman,\
      \ I seem to get this idea of an emergence from greyness, or darkness and I was\
      \ wondering if it's through this emergence from greyness that you have any reference\
      \ to Blake [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41513] in his emergence from chaos.\n\
      \ \nMargaret Atwood\n00:39:17\nI'll be very flattered, if I did. I'm afraid\
      \ I suffer by the comparison. I think that you're right in spotting it, I think\
      \ I would say that it's more like this, that if you want to think in terms of\
      \ colour, that you start with a grey, and then you go down. Down into, well,\
      \ it depends on the poem or the book or whatever of what's happening in your\
      \ life. And, but you have to go down before you come up again otherwise you\
      \ stay just in the grey part. If you want a real pattern for this, it's Dante's\
      \ [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1067] Inferno [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4509219],\
      \ where the man starts in a wandering wood, you know he starts in a kind of\
      \ state of being lost, and then he goes down into hell. The further down he\
      \ goes the more tortured souls he sees, but when he gets right to the bottom\
      \ he finds that he's going up again. And then he comes out the other side.\n\
      \ \nAudience Member 2\n00:40:19\nYeah, but, in this other side-ness in the Edible\
      \ Woman you come up through colours, a very [unintelligible] of colours and\
      \ I was wondering if this is the complete emergence of man?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n\
      00:40:29\nNot complete--I would say no, no beginning.\n \nAudience Member 2\n\
      00:40:32\n[Unintelligible] complete--into his universal aspect, but into an\
      \ emergence of man. Into the colours of life.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:40:39\n\
      Your choice of the word 'man' is interesting. Since the heroine is a woman.\
      \ [Audience laughter and applause]. Um, I think you have the pattern right.\
      \ I wouldn't like to attach any sort of universal meaning to it.\n \nAudience\
      \ Member 2\n00:40:56\nNo I'm not attaching a universal meaning, I'm attaching\
      \ more or less a universal meaning to the colour of darkness or greyness.\n\
      \ \nMargaret Atwood\n00:41:04\nNo, that's right, you're correct. Yes.\n \nAudience\
      \ Member 2\n00:41:07\nI'm not trying to express a universal meaning into these\
      \ colours, this is where you're taking it wrong.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:41:14\n\
      Well, I'm not too sure what we're talking about  to tell you the truth. You've\
      \ spotted a correct pattern and I'm not too sure how one interprets it because\
      \ I don't like to be the critic of  my own work in a way if you know what I\
      \ mean. Yes.\n \nAudience Member 3\n00:41:34\nI know you're writing a screenplay\
      \ for [unintelligible]. Will it ever become a film?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:41:39\n\
      Will it ever? Let's see now, I finished it at the end of July. Now, what is--the\
      \ stages of making a film are these: first somebody takes out an option on it,\
      \ which means they pay you X dollars to have the sole right to try to make the\
      \ movie for a certain period of time. If they fail to make it to renew the option\
      \ or to require the rights at the end of that period, you get it back and you\
      \ can then sell it to anybody else or back to them if you want. That's different\
      \ from buying the rights which means they've got it. And you can't get it back.\
      \ An option has been taken out, a script has been written. They are now doing\
      \ whatever it is they do, who knows. To try to put together what is called a\
      \ package, that is, they try to interest a director or they pick out a director\
      \ and they try to put a director together with a script together with some money.\
      \ And that's all going on, I don't know what's happening with it because they\
      \ don't tell. Yes.\n \nAudience Member 4\n00:42:42\nAre those people American\
      \ or Canadian?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:42:47\nThese people are. [Audience laughter].\
      \ Once upon a time there was an English Canadian film industry. Not very hard.\
      \ I mean it's trying very hard but not many results are being had. And I wanted\
      \ very much to make Surfacing in Canada with Canadian everything, but I was\
      \ about two years too late. And also Canadians are quite timmerus about this\
      \ book because they said \u201Cwell, it'll never be able to sell a film in the\
      \ States\u201D because of all that strange American symbolism in it. They--the\
      \ two people I'm working with are two American independent producers, not to\
      \ be confused with MGM [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q179200], who want to\
      \ make the book as it is, that is, they like the book, they want to be faithful\
      \ to it, they don't want to transport it to Maine [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q724]\
      \ or wherever and make it into an American film, which of course you couldn't\
      \ do without ruining the symbolic pattern. They want to make it in Canada, they\
      \ want to put in all that stuff because they say \u201Cwow, dynamite\u201D.\
      \ [Audience laughter]. They're not worried about selling it in the States. So\
      \ that's how we're proceeding right now and we have not yet had a falling out\
      \ on any of the crucial matters such as what's in the screenplay. And so that's\
      \ been fine. They would like to make it here. And what stage they're at right\
      \ now I don't know. Now if they don't put it together, then I get it back and\
      \ then I have another go. And I'll try it \u2018round Canada again, once more,\
      \ and I'll probably with the same results--\n \nAudience Member 4\n00:44:26\n\
      You have tried?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:44:30\nOh yes, everybody tries. I've\
      \ written four or five screenplays, none of them have been made. They've all\
      \ been for Canadians. One thing has happened, I got one television play done,\
      \ but of course everything you do for the CBC [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q461761]\
      \ pretty well gets done. [Audience laughter]. As you know. I wrote a screenplay\
      \ for Edible Woman that didn't get done. I wrote one for Marie-Claire Blais\
      \ [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q298358], Mad Shadows, we had high hopes for\
      \ that, that was a Canadian director, Canadian producer all the rest of it.\
      \ No deal. Film development corporations said it wasn't commercial enough. I\
      \ mean, you don't go outside before you've been through it for a while. It's\
      \ a problem that novelists used to face when trying to get their novels published\
      \ here.\n \nWynne Francis\n00:45:22\nI'd like to ask a question, and I can't\
      \ see what competition I've got, I can't see anything out there. On Wednesday\
      \ at Loyola, you gave comic tags to some of your critical opponents taken from\
      \ Koestler [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q78494], Yogis and Komisars are critics\
      \ that are formalists and culturally and politically aware and I wondered, do\
      \ you see the ideal critic or type of criticism as combining these two?\n \n\
      Margaret Atwood\n00:45:51\nWell, I think that people have certain talents, you\
      \ know, and they should exercise what talents they have, and that all kinds\
      \ of criticism should be available to the reader. I don't think that every critic\
      \ has to do everything, I think that would be asking a singer to be a dancer.\
      \ \n \nWynne Francis\n00:46:08\nI remember you saying it was good to have both\
      \ kinds, I wondered if you think they could be combined?\n \nAudience Member\
      \ 5\n00:46:16\nIs it possible that the body of knowledge turns into the knowing\
      \ body?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:46:20\nIs it possible that the body of knowledge\
      \ turns into the knowing body? Um, I'll let you answer that. If such a person\
      \ could do it, I'd like to see it, I've never seen anybody who could do both\
      \ at the same time. Frye [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q354256], for instance,\
      \ does one kind in one book and then another kind in another book, but he usually\
      \ doesn't usually do them both in the same book. I would say that Yogi-ism is\
      \ necessary to be able to read a poem, just period pure and simple. To see what\
      \ is happening in it. But Komasarism is necessary to place it in a larger context.\
      \ Why not do both? Yes, I see. Back there, you\n \nAudience Member 6\n00:47:08\n\
      Do you think that Quebec [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q176] is a part of Canada?\n\
      \ \nMargaret Atwood\n00:47:09\nOh that's such a good question.\n \nAudience\
      \ Member 6\n00:47:11\nDo you think that a Quebecois is a Canadian?\n \nMargaret\
      \ Atwood\n00:47:15\nI think I'll leave that to the Quebecois to decide for themselves.\
      \ They're the people concerned. [Audience applause]. I was talking with one\
      \ not so long ago, Marie-Claire Blais, and I asked her that question. I said,\
      \ \u201Cwell, what do you think of yourself as? Do you think of yourself as\
      \ a Quebecoise? or a Canadian? or a North-American, or part of Western European\
      \ culture or a universalist?\u201D And she said, \u201CI am from Quebec\u201D\
      . [Audience laughter]. Does that answer your question? Yes.\n \nAudience Member\
      \  7\n00:47:58\nWhat is your opinion of the introductions in the New Canadian\
      \ Library [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16998703] Series?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n\
      00:48:03\nWell, they vary. [Audience laughter]. Do you mean the one? Well, I\
      \ thought that it was, it was like a, well, the only thing I can think of is\
      \ something fairly vulgar, um, but I don't mean that I think it was bad. I mean\
      \ that I think it was quite a ponderous organization, being brought to bear\
      \ on what I consider to be a fairly light piece of writing. That is, at the\
      \ front of my book, I have a quotation from the Joy of Cooking which tells how\
      \ to make puff pastry. And then I have you know, critical sort of, really big\
      \ critical apparatus coming in and talking about the symbolic structuring and\
      \ the this and the that, and I think it's nice, I'm glad to know about those\
      \ things, but [audience laughter] it's somehow, I thought my novel was a bit\
      \ more comic than that. If you know what I mean.\n \nAudience Member 8\n00:49:09\n\
      Yeah, I wanted to ask a question. Yeah, I was wondering to what degree you consider\
      \ yourself to be an ironist because you're talking about [unintelligible] irony,\
      \ it seems to me that irony is the point I\u2019m most attracted to in your\
      \ work anyway.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:49:22\nYeah, well, you can have both\
      \ of course, as a matter of fact you usually do.\n \nAudience Member 8\n00:49:31\n\
      You were talking about anger, and \"permit me the present tense\" kind of thing,\
      \ seems to me that that was ironic.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:49:41\nAmbigu--it\
      \ has a double meaning. But that's not always irony, I think irony has been...Well,\
      \ somebody defined irony as a kind of literature in which the reader knows more\
      \ about what's going on with the character than the character knows himself,\
      \ shall we say. So, yes, of course, I think that happens in an awful lot of\
      \ modern literature. Yes.\n \nAudience Member 9\n00:50:14\nI understand you're\
      \ working on Survival Two?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:50:16\nNot working, exactly.\n\
      \ \nAudience Member 9\n00:50:22\nI was wondering whether you could, or would\
      \ like to elaborate on that.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:50:25\nYeah, okay. There\
      \ was to have been something called Survival Two, which was to have been this\
      \ really dynamite anthology. Which would have incorporated many of the short\
      \ pieces mentioned in Survival, plus other ones that were appropriate and we\
      \ did assemble this and then we had it priced as to how much it would cost for\
      \ permissions and how much it would cost us to print it and it was just astronomically\
      \ expensive. So we had to shelf that, and that was what Survival Two was to\
      \ have been. Now I'll probably publish the proposed table of contents sometime\
      \ and you can see what would have been in it. [Audience laughter]. You know,\
      \ but a small publisher cannot afford to do this kind of thing. However, I am,\
      \ I won't say working on because I'm working on it in the same sense that I'm\
      \ working on my Ph.D. thesis, what I'm really doing is writing a novel. But\
      \ I will, should I live that long, write a second edition of Survival, in which\
      \ I hope to have five new chapters and additions to the ones that already exist.\
      \ I think the thing about Survival that sometimes gets forgotten was that it\
      \ was based on what was available in paperback at the time. A lot more things\
      \ are available in paperback now, we have General Publishing coming on the scene,\
      \ with Paper Jacks,  and New Canadian Library expanding itself and Macmillan's\
      \ [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2108217] paperbacks expanding. So there's\
      \ just a lot more around that you can put in and also new books have been published\
      \ that I would like to talk about and I've discovered older ones that I didn't\
      \ know about before. So, all of these things, plus a new introduction and maybe\
      \ a few things at the back, I would like to do. However, I'm not quite ready\
      \ to do it yet. I took a kind of holiday after I finished Survival One, and\
      \ I'm still in that, it's a holiday devoted to writing other things. Yes,\n\
      \ \nAudience Member 10\n00:52:30\nWho are your favourite poets?\n \nMargaret\
      \ Atwood\n00:52:33\nI tend to have favourite poems, rather than favourite poets,\
      \ but I can tell you the names of some people who've written some of my favourite\
      \ poems. One of them is Margaret Avison [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6759152],\
      \ one of them is P.K. Page [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2755960], they're\
      \ poems by all kinds of people that I really like, for instance, I really like\
      \ some of A.M. Klein's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2778027] poems. I think\
      \ they're just super. And more modern people, for instance, Michael Ondaatje\
      \ [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313593], I like his work, Al Purdy [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4704621]\
      \ I was reading in the early to middle Sixties, Doug Jones [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5203595]\
      \ at that time. It covers a very wide range. I'm a kind of omnivorous reader,\
      \ I'll read anything, including the backs of Cornflake boxes, so that you just\
      \ never know, and it also changes, you know, because you read somebody for a\
      \ while and then you've done that so you go and read somebody else.\n\nAudience\
      \ Member 10\n00:53:31\n[Unintelligible].\n\nMargaret Atwood\n00:53:33\nOh yeah,\
      \ I get various little magazines come floating in through the mail to me, for\
      \ some reason. And right now, for instance, I'm reading a lot of Adrienne Rich\
      \ [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q270705], because I'm about to write a review\
      \ of her latest book. This kind of thing, I mean it varies from month to month.\
      \ If you ask me the same question in January the question would be different...Yeah.\n\
      \ \nAudience Member 11\n00:54:02\n[Unintelligible] Is Surfacing more than vaguely\
      \ autobiographical?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:54:11\nIt's vaguely, if you're talking\
      \ about the plot--no. The setting, yes, and this is generally true of fiction,\
      \ that people write from a setting that they know. They generally create characters\
      \ out of some people that they've known plus they throw things in and invent\
      \ them and make mosaics out of various things and the characters are fictional.\
      \ The plot is usually a total invention. I mean, my parents are still alive\
      \ and well, all of that. No, I have never been a paranoid schizophrenic with\
      \ amnesia. [Audience laughter]. And as for the Edible Woman, I've never gone\
      \ off food, but all kinds of other people have. You know, they come up to me\
      \ and say, \u201CGee, how did you know the story of my life\u201D and \u201C\
      that's happened to me and let me tell you it was awful, I used to throw up on\
      \ busses\u201D. I was kind of shocked, actually, I thought it was all a big\
      \ comic invention of my own. I see one waving at the back.\n \nAudience Member\
      \ 12\n00:55:20\nUm, excuse me, would you say that you base your characters on\
      \ some type of psychological background?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:55:25\nUm,\
      \ I try to make them believable insofar as it will fit the plot. That is, I\
      \ try to make what they do believable to myself, but they have to do what they\
      \ do if you see what I mean. Yes.\n \nAudience Member 13\n00:55:46\nWould you\
      \ say the Edible Woman is a comical invention of your own?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n\
      00:55:49\nI said I thought it was, yeah.\n \nAudience Member 13\n00:55:51\n\
      Well, how would you define that, as a comedy?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:55:54\n\
      Oh, okay, if you wanna be technical. Um, the Edible Woman is actually an anti-comedy.\
      \ Because a comedy is a form in which usually a young couple goes through a\
      \ series of misadventures and blokings and gets married at the end. Now in the\
      \ Edible Woman, a young couple goes through a series of misadventures and blokings\
      \ and somebody else gets married at the end. [Audience laughter]. Yes. \n \n\
      Audience Member 14\n00:56:24\nCould you tell us anything about the novel you're\
      \ writing now?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:56:26\nNot a thing, that's my one superstition--well,\
      \ it's one of my superstitions. I can't talk about work that I'm doing, it uses\
      \ up the energy. It's true. Yeah.\n \nAudience Member 15\n00:56:41\nI read the\
      \ Edible Woman right after reading a book by Robertson Davies [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q545375],\
      \ about [unintelligible].\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:56:49\nOkay, the question\
      \ is I read the Edible Woman right after reading a book by Robertson Davies,\
      \ Fifth Business [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5447489]?\n \nAudience Member\
      \ 15\n00:56:58\nNo, an earlier book.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:57:00\nManticore\
      \ [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7750230]?\n \nAudience Member 15\n00:57:00\n\
      It was a comedy\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:57:01\nOh, okay.\n \nAudience Member\
      \ 15\n00:57:02\nAbout a couple in a town [unintelligible] resolve it and they\
      \ get married. And I wondered why he wasn't mentioned in Survival at all.\n\
      \ \nMargaret Atwood\n00:57:15\nWell, I think probably because I wasn't doing\
      \ humour and I wasn't doing magic. But since I am doing humour and magic in\
      \ the next two chapters, then he will be in those. Samuel Marchbanks [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7412104]\
      \ will be in under humour and Fifth Business and Manticore will be in under\
      \ magic. I find the magician figure in Fifth Business very interesting from\
      \ this particular advantage point. Why do Canadian magicians have to disguise\
      \ themselves as foreigners in order to be thought of as magic. [Audience laughter.]\
      \ You find this in Gwen MacEwen [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4276487] too.\
      \ Specifically in the book called No Man.\n \nAudience Member 16\n00:58:04\n\
      Is that a novel?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:58:04\nIt is a series of short stories,\
      \ but there's sort of a central one in which you have the same pattern. Okay,\
      \ let's have one more if there is one more. There isn't one more, there's one\
      \ more.\n \nAudience Member 17\n00:58:22\nUm, the poems that you read tonight,\
      \ would you consider those the best or the most significant ones from your collection,\
      \ and if neither of those things, why did you select the ones that you read?\
      \ The reason that I've asked that is because I've read your latest book quite\
      \ carefully and I think that you read the, some of the best poems from it. I\
      \ was wondering if you thought they were some of the best poems.\n \nMargaret\
      \ Atwood\n00:58:45\nYeah. I think that one of the best things in it is section\
      \ number three, but that consists of twenty four poems, which seem to me to\
      \ be too long. I read some of them that I like quite a lot, yes, this is true,\
      \ but I left out some others that I also like quite a lot because it seemed\
      \ to me that they were too long and at this particular night anyway I felt that\
      \ I should get through as quickly as possible because we were all stifling to\
      \ death. Um, and with that I think that I will now end the question period and\
      \ we can all go out and have a drink of water. \n\nAudience\n00:59:24\nApplause\
      \ [cuts out briefly].\n \nWynne Francis\n00:59:38\nI'd just like to thank Margaret\
      \ Atwood very much for being with us tonight--\n\nAudience\n00:59:40\nLaughter.\n\

    notes: "Internationally acclaimed novelist, poet, critic and activist Margaret\
      \ Atwood was born in Ottawa, Ontario, November 18, 1939. She lived in Ottawa\
      \ until 1946, when her family settled in Leaside, a suburb of Toronto. Atwood\
      \ entered Victoria College, University of Toronto, graduating with honours in\
      \ 1961. Her first published collection of short stories was Double Persephone\
      \ (Hawkshead Press, 1961). By 1962 she had received her MA in English from Radcliffe\
      \ College in the United States, working on further graduate work at Harvard\
      \ University between 1962-3 and in 1965-7. Atwood published her second collection,\
      \ The Circle Game (Anansi, 1966), which won the Governor General Award for Poetry.\
      \ She wrote articles and reviews for Alphabet, Canadian Literature and Poetry\
      \ among other publications, and poems for Kayak, Quarry and the Tamarack Review.\
      \ Poems published in her book The Animals in That Country (Oxford University\
      \ Press, 1968) won first prize in Canada\u2019s 1967 Centennial Commission poetry\
      \ competition. In 1970, she published three books, Procedures for Underground\
      \ (Oxford University Press), Time, and The Journals of Susanna Moodie (Oxford\
      \ University Press). Between 1971 and 1973, Atwood worked as an editor and on\
      \ the board of directors for the House of Anansi press in Toronto, which in\
      \ 1972 published Power Politics. Upon the discovery at Harvard that there was\
      \ no published critical study of Canadian literature, she herself wrote and\
      \ published Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature (Anansi, 1971),\
      \ which created a stir of controversy, but by 1982 it had sold more than 85,000\
      \ copies. Since 1973, she has lived with novelist and activist Graeme Gibson,\
      \ producing one daughter, Eleanor Jess in 1967. Atwood taught and lectured at\
      \ several Universities across Canada, the US and Australia, including University\
      \ of British Columbia, University of Alberta, Sir George Williams University\
      \ (now Concordia) (1967-68) and at York University, Toronto. A selection of\
      \ her publications include Surfacing (Simon & Schuster, 1972), You Are Happy\
      \ (Harper & Row, 1974), Selected Poems (Oxford University Press) in 1976, Two-Headed\
      \ Poems (Simon & Schuster, 1978), True Stories (Oxford University Press, 1981)\
      \ and Second Words (Anansi, 1982). Her 1985 novel, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\
      \ (McClelland & Stewart) became one of her most popular and critically acclaimed\
      \ works. In 1986 she was appointed the Berg Chair at New York University, as\
      \ well as serving as writer-in-residence at several other Universities. She\
      \ co-founded and served as chair to the Writer\u2019s Union of Canada in 1982-3,\
      \ and served as president of the Canadian Centre of International PEN from 1984-6.\
      \ She has subsequently published dozens of books, including Cat\u2019s Eye (McClelland\
      \ & Stewart, 1988), The Robber Bride (Doubleday, 1993), Alias Grace (Nan A.\
      \ Talese, 1996), The Blind Assassin (Nan A. Talese, 2000), Oryx and Crake (2003),\
      \ The Penelopiad (Canongate, 2005) and The Tent (Bloomsbury, 2006). Along with\
      \ many other publications of her critical essays, Curious Pursuits: Occasional\
      \ Writing 1970-2005 (Verago) came out in 2005. Her many prizes and honours include\
      \ the Booker Prize, the E.J. Pratt Medal (1961), The Radcliffe Medal (1980),\
      \ the Commonwealth Writers Prize (1992), and she is a Companion of the Order\

      \ problem that we have here at Sir George [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q326342].\
      \ We did try to get a larger hall but it was impossible. To accommodate the\
      \ overflow, we have set up loudspeakers in the little gallery here, Howard,\
      \ and in the other one too?\n \nHoward Fink\n00:00:21\nOutside.\n \nHenry Beissel\n\
      00:00:22\nOutside, there are loudspeakers. So please don't all crowd into the\
      \ room. If you are going to lean against the paintings, we shall never be able\
      \ to get this room again for poetry readings. Because this, this is a gallery\
      \ which belongs to the Fine Arts department, we had great difficulty getting\
      \ it, these paintings are very precious, particularly to the artists themselves\
      \ [audience laughter]. I would ask you please to stay away from the paintings.\
      \ That must have been the artist [audience laughter]. We are also waiting for\
      \ the arrival of someone else, so please be patient. Howard--[audience laughter]\
      \ can you ask the security people to turn on the cooling system, the hall is\
      \ going to be too hot.\n \nUnknown\n00:01:22\nAmbient Sound [voices].\n \nHenry\
      \ Beissel\n00:01:25\nWe may get 927.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:01:30\nWhat do\
      \ you mean, we may, I think they're also--okay. What would you like to do? Let\
      \ us stay here or move?\n \nAudience\n00:01:41\nStay here.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n\
      00:01:44\nOkay, with the people, there are some people who are at the back of\
      \ the door, there is some space up here at the front if you'd like to come up.\n\
      \ \nHenry Beissel\n00:01:54\nNo more than ten.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:01:58\n\
      About ten. It'll make more room at the back too...If everybody on the chairs\
      \ would shift over this way, um, and sit on, sort of as if it were a bench,\
      \ then some more people can sit on the edges there. Or just move the chairs\
      \ all that way. Move the rows forward. They're all shifting over anyway. Could\
      \ you all move your chairs forward to make the rows as close together as possible.\
      \ Okay, it's alright. \n\nUnknown\n00:03:17\nAmbient Sound [voices].\n\nMargaret\
      \ Atwood\n00:04:41\nThere are these uhh--woohoo--there are these speakers outside\
      \ and you might be more comfortable if you went out and listened over the speakers,\
      \ some of the people are really jammed in there. I don't see any reason why\
      \ this thing should resemble a steam bath, for all of us. If you're--what? what?...I\
      \ don't think I can, what is it that they do? [Audience laughter].\n \nWynne\
      \ Francis\n00:05:19\n[Laughter]. Miss Atwood [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q183492]\
      \ has just upstaged the introducer. Good evening ladies and gentlemen. It's\
      \ not often that an artist excels in two medium such as poetry and fiction as\
      \ our guest tonight does. Miss Atwood's reputation as a superior poet was established\
      \ in the 60's with her first collections, The Circle Game [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7723073]\
      \ and The Animals in that Country [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7713834].\
      \ And while continuing to write fine poetry, six major collections to date,\
      \ she's given  us two novels in the last five years, The Edible Woman [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7731579]\
      \ and Surfacing. With the second novel, published late in 1972, within a few\
      \ months of a controversial work of criticism, Margaret Atwood became one of\
      \ Canada's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16] best known literary artists.\
      \ The hypothesis of Survival, a study of patterns in Canadian lit is that Canadians\
      \ see themselves as victims. I was remind of Survival recently when I came across\
      \ a nineteenth-century curiosity written by one John McTaggart [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q463553].\
      \ It was a book published in London [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q84] in 19--\
      \ excuse me--1829. McTaggart wrote \"There's a melancholy which is peculiar\
      \ to Canadians which must be combatted. People who labor under it must be encouraged,\
      \ the soothing language, good treatment and now and then as circumstances require,\
      \ a little assistance gratis as a stimulant.\" McTaggart's third point about\
      \ the helpful effects of a little assistance as a recent theory has been taken\
      \ up by the Canada Council [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2993809], to whom\
      \ we are in part indebted for her appearance tonight. Margaret Atwood's work\
      \ constitutes an exploration of what it means to be a Canadian, to be a woman\
      \ and to be a human being. She writes about our totems, our tapestry of manners,\
      \ our progressive insanities. She taught at Sir George in 67-68, and it's a\
      \ great pleasure to have her return to us tonight. After her reading, she'll\
      \ be open to questions from the audience. Ladies and gentlemen, Margaret Atwood.\n\
      \nAudience\n00:07:27\nApplause [cuts out briefly].\n\nMargaret Atwood\n00:07:38\n\
      Let's see now, if the mic starts to get funny, let me know...Too loud?...Not\
      \ too loud, I'm afraid it isn't a very good mic and also I'm afraid I'm going\
      \ to have to hold it the whole time which is a bore...I don't think it'll work\
      \ very well, is that better? Does that work? Higher? Lower? Okay, how's that?\
      \ Okay, I'm going to read entirely from my new book which is called \"This is\"\
      --oh, what is it called? [audience laughter]. It's called You Are Happy. Somebody\
      \ who has been photographing me says that a friend of hers was in a bookstore\
      \ and picked out this book and thought at first that this was one of these \"\
      I'm Okay, You're Okay\" books. Until I saw who wrote it. [Audience laughter].\
      \ But it has a happy ending, you'll be pleased to know. And I'm going to begin\
      \ at the beginning and end at the end. Skipping portions along the way. I'm\
      \ also going to make this reading fairly short because we are all in this rather\
      \ constricted situation. I used to tell people when people in the States [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30]\
      \ used to ask me \u201Cdo you live in an igloo\u201D and other questions like\
      \ that, I used to think to myself that being a Canadian was sort of like living\
      \ in a chicken coop in the middle of the desert. That everybody was all together\
      \ in one place but there are these huge spaces around. I wish that  we had been\
      \ provided with one of them. [Audience laughter]. I have a chicken coop, and\
      \ you're nicer. But there are more of you. I think we will all have to be very,\
      \ very patient, unlike the chickens. I'm going to begin by reading a poem called\
      \ \"Newsreel: Man and Firing Squad\".\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:10:04\nReads \"\
      Newsreel: Man and Firing Squad\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:11:42\n\
      Reads \"Useless\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:12:35\nThis is--the\
      \ image in this next poem comes from, begins with the fact that I have a sheep\
      \ and one of them died. The poem is called \"November\".\n \nMargaret Atwood\n\
      00:12:48\nReads \"November\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:13:52\n\
      Reads \"Repent\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:14:47\n\"Tricks\
      \ with Mirrors\". How are you doing? Is it hot and steamy? Has anybody died\
      \ yet?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:15:05\nReads \"Tricks with Mirrors\" from You\
      \ Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:17:45\nThis is the title poem, \"You Are\
      \ Happy\".\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:17:50\nReads \"You are Happy\" from You Are\
      \ Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:18:48\nReads \"First Prayer\" from You Are\
      \ Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:20:25\n\"Is / Not: 1\". Oh boy, is it ever\
      \ hot in here. I can't stand it. Light. I wonder if we could--well, then I can't\
      \ see, you see. I wonder if we could turn off--would it be better if we turn\
      \ off those lights that are grilling you over there...I could what?...Where's\
      \ the light switch anyway? Howard, turn off the lights?...Well, maybe in a few\
      \ minutes the lights will go off. Where did\u2026\n\nUnknown\n00:21:36\n[Cut\
      \ or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed]. \n\nMargaret Atwood\n\
      00:21:37\nHooray, wonderful. Actually, there's a light under here. It's like\
      \ the Saturday movies [audience laughter]. No, I can read with this, yeah. Maybe\
      \ I'll just read a little something else here, because it's the Saturday Movies.\n\
      \ \nMargaret Atwood\n00:22:18\nReads [\"You take my hand\" from Power Politics;\
      \ audience laughter throughout].\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:23:13\nAnd since we\
      \ were talking about the war between Superman [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79015]\
      \ and Captain Marvel [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q534153] at dinner, my favourite\
      \ was Plastic Man [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q746838], but that was an esoteric\
      \ taste. I'll read this one.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:23:28\nReads \"They Eat\
      \ Out\" [from Power Politics].\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:24:44\nI go to--I can't\
      \ resist this. This is from the new book, it's called \"Siren Song\". Students\
      \ of Seventeenth Century Literature are always asking themselves and each other,\
      \ what song the sirens sang, and this is the ultimate answer.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n\
      00:25:06\nReads \"Siren Song\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:26:12\n\
      The imminent critic, Allen Pearson, who was once known when he lived in Montreal\
      \ [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q340] as the Montreal Poet, now that he lives\
      \ in Toronto [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q172], he's probably known as the\
      \ Toronto Poet, says the following: \"Siren Song tells how boring it is for\
      \ a woman to be obliged to attract men by appealing to them for help\". [Audience\
      \ laughter]. Um, since I'm on the subject of people in capes and costumes, I'll\
      \ read...\n \nUnknown\n00:26:56\n[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of\
      \ time elapsed].\n\nAnnotation\n00:26:57\nReads [untitled poem from the \u201C\
      Circle/Mud Poems\u201D section in You Are Happy].\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:28:20\n\
      Reads \"Is / Not\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:30:37\nI think\
      \ I'd better read just three more poems, before we all die. The first one is\
      \ called \"There is Only One of Everything\".\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:30:54\n\
      Reads \"There is Only One of Everything\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n\
      00:32:30\nReads \"Late August\" from You Are Happy.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:33:26\n\
      This is the last poem, called \"Book of Ancestors\".\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:33:33\n\
      Reads \"Book of Ancestors\" from You Are Happy. \n \nAudience\n00:36:31\nApplause\
      \ [cuts out briefly].\n\nWynne Francis\n00:36:47\nThank you, it's really not\
      \ so hot if you sit still. Miss Atwood is prepared to discuss, for a little\
      \ while.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:37:04\nIf you would like to, uh, I can't see\
      \ a thing of course, I can sort of see hands if you stick them up and wave them\
      \ around. Would that be better than turning back on the lights which I'd prefer\
      \ not to do?\n \nWynne Francis\n00:37:22\nThere's no way we can get mics in\
      \ the audience, so please speak loudly.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:37:23\nI see\
      \ a hand.\n \nAudience Member 1\n00:37:28\nHow did your nickname of a witch\
      \ get originated?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:37:30\nHow did my nickname of a witch?\
      \ Are you referring to the speech I gave the other night at Loyola? Oh, it's,\
      \ I was talking about a couple of reviews, that seemed to credit me with having\
      \ these supernatural powers, you know, the ability to hypnotize my readers and\
      \ things like that, and what I was saying was that in fact I don't in fact possess\
      \ the powers of hypnotism or I'd use them on my bank manager and be quite rich.\
      \ Um, I was talking about a pattern that seems to crop up from time to time\
      \ in a certain kind of review usually written by men. [Audience laughter]. I\
      \ heard that there were a couple of people in the audience at Loyola who before\
      \ the speech, were convinced that I was a witch and that I was going to talk\
      \ about witchcraft, and when I said that I wasn't one, they left. [Audience\
      \ laughter]. You see, if I were a witch, I wouldn't be able to wear the cross.\
      \ So that's how you can tell I'm not. Wards off vampires. Um, yes?\n \nAudience\
      \ Member 2\n00:38:54\nUm, [unintelligible] and as well as the Edible Woman,\
      \ I seem to get this idea of an emergence from greyness, or darkness and I was\
      \ wondering if it's through this emergence from greyness that you have any reference\
      \ to Blake [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41513] in his emergence from chaos.\n\
      \ \nMargaret Atwood\n00:39:17\nI'll be very flattered, if I did. I'm afraid\
      \ I suffer by the comparison. I think that you're right in spotting it, I think\
      \ I would say that it's more like this, that if you want to think in terms of\
      \ colour, that you start with a grey, and then you go down. Down into, well,\
      \ it depends on the poem or the book or whatever of what's happening in your\
      \ life. And, but you have to go down before you come up again otherwise you\
      \ stay just in the grey part. If you want a real pattern for this, it's Dante's\
      \ [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1067] Inferno [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4509219],\
      \ where the man starts in a wandering wood, you know he starts in a kind of\
      \ state of being lost, and then he goes down into hell. The further down he\
      \ goes the more tortured souls he sees, but when he gets right to the bottom\
      \ he finds that he's going up again. And then he comes out the other side.\n\
      \ \nAudience Member 2\n00:40:19\nYeah, but, in this other side-ness in the Edible\
      \ Woman you come up through colours, a very [unintelligible] of colours and\
      \ I was wondering if this is the complete emergence of man?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n\
      00:40:29\nNot complete--I would say no, no beginning.\n \nAudience Member 2\n\
      00:40:32\n[Unintelligible] complete--into his universal aspect, but into an\
      \ emergence of man. Into the colours of life.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:40:39\n\
      Your choice of the word 'man' is interesting. Since the heroine is a woman.\
      \ [Audience laughter and applause]. Um, I think you have the pattern right.\
      \ I wouldn't like to attach any sort of universal meaning to it.\n \nAudience\
      \ Member 2\n00:40:56\nNo I'm not attaching a universal meaning, I'm attaching\
      \ more or less a universal meaning to the colour of darkness or greyness.\n\
      \ \nMargaret Atwood\n00:41:04\nNo, that's right, you're correct. Yes.\n \nAudience\
      \ Member 2\n00:41:07\nI'm not trying to express a universal meaning into these\
      \ colours, this is where you're taking it wrong.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:41:14\n\
      Well, I'm not too sure what we're talking about  to tell you the truth. You've\
      \ spotted a correct pattern and I'm not too sure how one interprets it because\
      \ I don't like to be the critic of  my own work in a way if you know what I\
      \ mean. Yes.\n \nAudience Member 3\n00:41:34\nI know you're writing a screenplay\
      \ for [unintelligible]. Will it ever become a film?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:41:39\n\
      Will it ever? Let's see now, I finished it at the end of July. Now, what is--the\
      \ stages of making a film are these: first somebody takes out an option on it,\
      \ which means they pay you X dollars to have the sole right to try to make the\
      \ movie for a certain period of time. If they fail to make it to renew the option\
      \ or to require the rights at the end of that period, you get it back and you\
      \ can then sell it to anybody else or back to them if you want. That's different\
      \ from buying the rights which means they've got it. And you can't get it back.\
      \ An option has been taken out, a script has been written. They are now doing\
      \ whatever it is they do, who knows. To try to put together what is called a\
      \ package, that is, they try to interest a director or they pick out a director\
      \ and they try to put a director together with a script together with some money.\
      \ And that's all going on, I don't know what's happening with it because they\
      \ don't tell. Yes.\n \nAudience Member 4\n00:42:42\nAre those people American\
      \ or Canadian?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:42:47\nThese people are. [Audience laughter].\
      \ Once upon a time there was an English Canadian film industry. Not very hard.\
      \ I mean it's trying very hard but not many results are being had. And I wanted\
      \ very much to make Surfacing in Canada with Canadian everything, but I was\
      \ about two years too late. And also Canadians are quite timmerus about this\
      \ book because they said \u201Cwell, it'll never be able to sell a film in the\
      \ States\u201D because of all that strange American symbolism in it. They--the\
      \ two people I'm working with are two American independent producers, not to\
      \ be confused with MGM [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q179200], who want to\
      \ make the book as it is, that is, they like the book, they want to be faithful\
      \ to it, they don't want to transport it to Maine [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q724]\
      \ or wherever and make it into an American film, which of course you couldn't\
      \ do without ruining the symbolic pattern. They want to make it in Canada, they\
      \ want to put in all that stuff because they say \u201Cwow, dynamite\u201D.\
      \ [Audience laughter]. They're not worried about selling it in the States. So\
      \ that's how we're proceeding right now and we have not yet had a falling out\
      \ on any of the crucial matters such as what's in the screenplay. And so that's\
      \ been fine. They would like to make it here. And what stage they're at right\
      \ now I don't know. Now if they don't put it together, then I get it back and\
      \ then I have another go. And I'll try it \u2018round Canada again, once more,\
      \ and I'll probably with the same results--\n \nAudience Member 4\n00:44:26\n\
      You have tried?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:44:30\nOh yes, everybody tries. I've\
      \ written four or five screenplays, none of them have been made. They've all\
      \ been for Canadians. One thing has happened, I got one television play done,\
      \ but of course everything you do for the CBC [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q461761]\
      \ pretty well gets done. [Audience laughter]. As you know. I wrote a screenplay\
      \ for Edible Woman that didn't get done. I wrote one for Marie-Claire Blais\
      \ [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q298358], Mad Shadows, we had high hopes for\
      \ that, that was a Canadian director, Canadian producer all the rest of it.\
      \ No deal. Film development corporations said it wasn't commercial enough. I\
      \ mean, you don't go outside before you've been through it for a while. It's\
      \ a problem that novelists used to face when trying to get their novels published\
      \ here.\n \nWynne Francis\n00:45:22\nI'd like to ask a question, and I can't\
      \ see what competition I've got, I can't see anything out there. On Wednesday\
      \ at Loyola, you gave comic tags to some of your critical opponents taken from\
      \ Koestler [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q78494], Yogis and Komisars are critics\
      \ that are formalists and culturally and politically aware and I wondered, do\
      \ you see the ideal critic or type of criticism as combining these two?\n \n\
      Margaret Atwood\n00:45:51\nWell, I think that people have certain talents, you\
      \ know, and they should exercise what talents they have, and that all kinds\
      \ of criticism should be available to the reader. I don't think that every critic\
      \ has to do everything, I think that would be asking a singer to be a dancer.\
      \ \n \nWynne Francis\n00:46:08\nI remember you saying it was good to have both\
      \ kinds, I wondered if you think they could be combined?\n \nAudience Member\
      \ 5\n00:46:16\nIs it possible that the body of knowledge turns into the knowing\
      \ body?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:46:20\nIs it possible that the body of knowledge\
      \ turns into the knowing body? Um, I'll let you answer that. If such a person\
      \ could do it, I'd like to see it, I've never seen anybody who could do both\
      \ at the same time. Frye [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q354256], for instance,\
      \ does one kind in one book and then another kind in another book, but he usually\
      \ doesn't usually do them both in the same book. I would say that Yogi-ism is\
      \ necessary to be able to read a poem, just period pure and simple. To see what\
      \ is happening in it. But Komasarism is necessary to place it in a larger context.\
      \ Why not do both? Yes, I see. Back there, you\n \nAudience Member 6\n00:47:08\n\
      Do you think that Quebec [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q176] is a part of Canada?\n\
      \ \nMargaret Atwood\n00:47:09\nOh that's such a good question.\n \nAudience\
      \ Member 6\n00:47:11\nDo you think that a Quebecois is a Canadian?\n \nMargaret\
      \ Atwood\n00:47:15\nI think I'll leave that to the Quebecois to decide for themselves.\
      \ They're the people concerned. [Audience applause]. I was talking with one\
      \ not so long ago, Marie-Claire Blais, and I asked her that question. I said,\
      \ \u201Cwell, what do you think of yourself as? Do you think of yourself as\
      \ a Quebecoise? or a Canadian? or a North-American, or part of Western European\
      \ culture or a universalist?\u201D And she said, \u201CI am from Quebec\u201D\
      . [Audience laughter]. Does that answer your question? Yes.\n \nAudience Member\
      \  7\n00:47:58\nWhat is your opinion of the introductions in the New Canadian\
      \ Library [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16998703] Series?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n\
      00:48:03\nWell, they vary. [Audience laughter]. Do you mean the one? Well, I\
      \ thought that it was, it was like a, well, the only thing I can think of is\
      \ something fairly vulgar, um, but I don't mean that I think it was bad. I mean\
      \ that I think it was quite a ponderous organization, being brought to bear\
      \ on what I consider to be a fairly light piece of writing. That is, at the\
      \ front of my book, I have a quotation from the Joy of Cooking which tells how\
      \ to make puff pastry. And then I have you know, critical sort of, really big\
      \ critical apparatus coming in and talking about the symbolic structuring and\
      \ the this and the that, and I think it's nice, I'm glad to know about those\
      \ things, but [audience laughter] it's somehow, I thought my novel was a bit\
      \ more comic than that. If you know what I mean.\n \nAudience Member 8\n00:49:09\n\
      Yeah, I wanted to ask a question. Yeah, I was wondering to what degree you consider\
      \ yourself to be an ironist because you're talking about [unintelligible] irony,\
      \ it seems to me that irony is the point I\u2019m most attracted to in your\
      \ work anyway.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:49:22\nYeah, well, you can have both\
      \ of course, as a matter of fact you usually do.\n \nAudience Member 8\n00:49:31\n\
      You were talking about anger, and \"permit me the present tense\" kind of thing,\
      \ seems to me that that was ironic.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:49:41\nAmbigu--it\
      \ has a double meaning. But that's not always irony, I think irony has been...Well,\
      \ somebody defined irony as a kind of literature in which the reader knows more\
      \ about what's going on with the character than the character knows himself,\
      \ shall we say. So, yes, of course, I think that happens in an awful lot of\
      \ modern literature. Yes.\n \nAudience Member 9\n00:50:14\nI understand you're\
      \ working on Survival Two?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:50:16\nNot working, exactly.\n\
      \ \nAudience Member 9\n00:50:22\nI was wondering whether you could, or would\
      \ like to elaborate on that.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:50:25\nYeah, okay. There\
      \ was to have been something called Survival Two, which was to have been this\
      \ really dynamite anthology. Which would have incorporated many of the short\
      \ pieces mentioned in Survival, plus other ones that were appropriate and we\
      \ did assemble this and then we had it priced as to how much it would cost for\
      \ permissions and how much it would cost us to print it and it was just astronomically\
      \ expensive. So we had to shelf that, and that was what Survival Two was to\
      \ have been. Now I'll probably publish the proposed table of contents sometime\
      \ and you can see what would have been in it. [Audience laughter]. You know,\
      \ but a small publisher cannot afford to do this kind of thing. However, I am,\
      \ I won't say working on because I'm working on it in the same sense that I'm\
      \ working on my Ph.D. thesis, what I'm really doing is writing a novel. But\
      \ I will, should I live that long, write a second edition of Survival, in which\
      \ I hope to have five new chapters and additions to the ones that already exist.\
      \ I think the thing about Survival that sometimes gets forgotten was that it\
      \ was based on what was available in paperback at the time. A lot more things\
      \ are available in paperback now, we have General Publishing coming on the scene,\
      \ with Paper Jacks,  and New Canadian Library expanding itself and Macmillan's\
      \ [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2108217] paperbacks expanding. So there's\
      \ just a lot more around that you can put in and also new books have been published\
      \ that I would like to talk about and I've discovered older ones that I didn't\
      \ know about before. So, all of these things, plus a new introduction and maybe\
      \ a few things at the back, I would like to do. However, I'm not quite ready\
      \ to do it yet. I took a kind of holiday after I finished Survival One, and\
      \ I'm still in that, it's a holiday devoted to writing other things. Yes,\n\
      \ \nAudience Member 10\n00:52:30\nWho are your favourite poets?\n \nMargaret\
      \ Atwood\n00:52:33\nI tend to have favourite poems, rather than favourite poets,\
      \ but I can tell you the names of some people who've written some of my favourite\
      \ poems. One of them is Margaret Avison [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6759152],\
      \ one of them is P.K. Page [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2755960], they're\
      \ poems by all kinds of people that I really like, for instance, I really like\
      \ some of A.M. Klein's [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2778027] poems. I think\
      \ they're just super. And more modern people, for instance, Michael Ondaatje\
      \ [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313593], I like his work, Al Purdy [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4704621]\
      \ I was reading in the early to middle Sixties, Doug Jones [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5203595]\
      \ at that time. It covers a very wide range. I'm a kind of omnivorous reader,\
      \ I'll read anything, including the backs of Cornflake boxes, so that you just\
      \ never know, and it also changes, you know, because you read somebody for a\
      \ while and then you've done that so you go and read somebody else.\n\nAudience\
      \ Member 10\n00:53:31\n[Unintelligible].\n\nMargaret Atwood\n00:53:33\nOh yeah,\
      \ I get various little magazines come floating in through the mail to me, for\
      \ some reason. And right now, for instance, I'm reading a lot of Adrienne Rich\
      \ [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q270705], because I'm about to write a review\
      \ of her latest book. This kind of thing, I mean it varies from month to month.\
      \ If you ask me the same question in January the question would be different...Yeah.\n\
      \ \nAudience Member 11\n00:54:02\n[Unintelligible] Is Surfacing more than vaguely\
      \ autobiographical?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:54:11\nIt's vaguely, if you're talking\
      \ about the plot--no. The setting, yes, and this is generally true of fiction,\
      \ that people write from a setting that they know. They generally create characters\
      \ out of some people that they've known plus they throw things in and invent\
      \ them and make mosaics out of various things and the characters are fictional.\
      \ The plot is usually a total invention. I mean, my parents are still alive\
      \ and well, all of that. No, I have never been a paranoid schizophrenic with\
      \ amnesia. [Audience laughter]. And as for the Edible Woman, I've never gone\
      \ off food, but all kinds of other people have. You know, they come up to me\
      \ and say, \u201CGee, how did you know the story of my life\u201D and \u201C\
      that's happened to me and let me tell you it was awful, I used to throw up on\
      \ busses\u201D. I was kind of shocked, actually, I thought it was all a big\
      \ comic invention of my own. I see one waving at the back.\n \nAudience Member\
      \ 12\n00:55:20\nUm, excuse me, would you say that you base your characters on\
      \ some type of psychological background?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:55:25\nUm,\
      \ I try to make them believable insofar as it will fit the plot. That is, I\
      \ try to make what they do believable to myself, but they have to do what they\
      \ do if you see what I mean. Yes.\n \nAudience Member 13\n00:55:46\nWould you\
      \ say the Edible Woman is a comical invention of your own?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n\
      00:55:49\nI said I thought it was, yeah.\n \nAudience Member 13\n00:55:51\n\
      Well, how would you define that, as a comedy?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:55:54\n\
      Oh, okay, if you wanna be technical. Um, the Edible Woman is actually an anti-comedy.\
      \ Because a comedy is a form in which usually a young couple goes through a\
      \ series of misadventures and blokings and gets married at the end. Now in the\
      \ Edible Woman, a young couple goes through a series of misadventures and blokings\
      \ and somebody else gets married at the end. [Audience laughter]. Yes. \n \n\
      Audience Member 14\n00:56:24\nCould you tell us anything about the novel you're\
      \ writing now?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:56:26\nNot a thing, that's my one superstition--well,\
      \ it's one of my superstitions. I can't talk about work that I'm doing, it uses\
      \ up the energy. It's true. Yeah.\n \nAudience Member 15\n00:56:41\nI read the\
      \ Edible Woman right after reading a book by Robertson Davies [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q545375],\
      \ about [unintelligible].\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:56:49\nOkay, the question\
      \ is I read the Edible Woman right after reading a book by Robertson Davies,\
      \ Fifth Business [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5447489]?\n \nAudience Member\
      \ 15\n00:56:58\nNo, an earlier book.\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:57:00\nManticore\
      \ [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7750230]?\n \nAudience Member 15\n00:57:00\n\
      It was a comedy\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:57:01\nOh, okay.\n \nAudience Member\
      \ 15\n00:57:02\nAbout a couple in a town [unintelligible] resolve it and they\
      \ get married. And I wondered why he wasn't mentioned in Survival at all.\n\
      \ \nMargaret Atwood\n00:57:15\nWell, I think probably because I wasn't doing\
      \ humour and I wasn't doing magic. But since I am doing humour and magic in\
      \ the next two chapters, then he will be in those. Samuel Marchbanks [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7412104]\
      \ will be in under humour and Fifth Business and Manticore will be in under\
      \ magic. I find the magician figure in Fifth Business very interesting from\
      \ this particular advantage point. Why do Canadian magicians have to disguise\
      \ themselves as foreigners in order to be thought of as magic. [Audience laughter.]\
      \ You find this in Gwen MacEwen [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4276487] too.\
      \ Specifically in the book called No Man.\n \nAudience Member 16\n00:58:04\n\
      Is that a novel?\n \nMargaret Atwood\n00:58:04\nIt is a series of short stories,\
      \ but there's sort of a central one in which you have the same pattern. Okay,\
      \ let's have one more if there is one more. There isn't one more, there's one\
      \ more.\n \nAudience Member 17\n00:58:22\nUm, the poems that you read tonight,\
      \ would you consider those the best or the most significant ones from your collection,\
      \ and if neither of those things, why did you select the ones that you read?\
      \ The reason that I've asked that is because I've read your latest book quite\
      \ carefully and I think that you read the, some of the best poems from it. I\
      \ was wondering if you thought they were some of the best poems.\n \nMargaret\
      \ Atwood\n00:58:45\nYeah. I think that one of the best things in it is section\
      \ number three, but that consists of twenty four poems, which seem to me to\
      \ be too long. I read some of them that I like quite a lot, yes, this is true,\
      \ but I left out some others that I also like quite a lot because it seemed\
      \ to me that they were too long and at this particular night anyway I felt that\
      \ I should get through as quickly as possible because we were all stifling to\
      \ death. Um, and with that I think that I will now end the question period and\
      \ we can all go out and have a drink of water. \n\nAudience\n00:59:24\nApplause\
      \ [cuts out briefly].\n \nWynne Francis\n00:59:38\nI'd just like to thank Margaret\
      \ Atwood very much for being with us tonight--\n\nAudience\n00:59:40\nLaughter.\n\

      \ the Poetry Reading Committee of this university, Mr. Roy Kiyooka [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3445789],\
      \ Mrs. Wynne Francis, Mr. Howard Fink, Mr. Irving Layton [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1673289],\
      \ and Mr. Stanton Hoffman, I wish to welcome you to the second reading in our\
      \ fall series. The reader for this evening is Mr. Anthony Hecht [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3618497]\
      \ of New York City [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60]. Mr. Hecht was born in\
      \ New York City. He is a fellow of the American Academy in Rome [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q463271].\
      \ He is the author of two volumes of poetry, A Summoning of Stones, which was\
      \ published by Macmillan [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2108217] in New York\
      \ City in 1954, and a later volume published in Northampton, Massachusetts [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49186]\
      \ in 1958, Seven Deadly Sins. Mr. Hecht is a poetry editor of The Hudson Review\
      \ [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15708605]. Mr. Hecht has also been a faculty\
      \ member of such universities as Smith [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49204],\
      \ New York University [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49210] and Bard College\
      \ [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49109], and he will be joining the faculty\
      \ of the University of Rochester [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q149990] very\
      \ soon. Mr. Hecht is the author of three forthcoming volumes: The Hard Hours,\
      \ which is to be published soon by Viking [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q921536],\
      \ a volume called Double Dactyls, which is to appear about Christmas and is\
      \ to be published by Atheneum [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4813415], and\
      \ a volume of verse epigrams to the engravings of Thomas Bewick [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q437594],\
      \ which is to be published by the Harvard University Press [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1587900].\
      \ Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Anthony Hecht. \n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:01:36\nThank\
      \ you very much. It's a pleasure to be here, this is my first trip to Canada\
      \ [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16], and I regret that it should be so brief.\
      \ I must leave tomorrow, but I'm struck by the frigidity of the weather and\
      \ the warmth of the greeting that I received upon arriving. I'd like to begin\
      \ with a poem which I'll, is set in Italy [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q38],\
      \ where I spent quite a while. It's called \"A Hill\", and it's what...about\
      \ a purported visionary experience. \n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:02:21\nReads \"A\
      \ Hill\" from The Hard Hours..\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:04:50\nThe next is called\
      \ \"A Letter\". Some of these, I think, will require some sort of explanatory\
      \ comment from me, but I don't think this will. \n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:04:59\n\
      Reads \"A Letter\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:06:44\nThe next\
      \ is called \"The Vow\". I should say that all the poems that I want to read\
      \ to you this evening are from a book called The Hard Hours. They...the book\
      \ is, I fear, for better or for worse, somewhat on the grim side, as the title\
      \ is meant to indicate. It perhaps is a corrective to the abundant cheerfulness\
      \ of my first book. But I hope that there were a few light moments here and\
      \ there. This one, on the other--is somewhat grim. It is in fact about a miscarriage.\
      \ And I had better explain to you that a large part of the second stanza, and\
      \ all of the third stanza is spoken by the ghost of the child who fails to be\
      \ born. It is called \"The Vow\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:07:42\nReads \"The Vow\"\
      \ from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:10:01\nThe next one is also somewhat\
      \ on the grim side, but it requires an appeasing little note of explanation.\
      \ Its title is \"More Light! More Light!\" which purport to be the last words\
      \ of Goethe [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5879] on his deathbed. There's been\
      \ a good deal of discussion and dispute as to quite what he meant at the time,\
      \ which may simply have been to raise the shade. But inasmuch as he is regarded\
      \ as the spirit of the German Enlightenment, a great deal more profound significance\
      \ is normally attached to those words. He plays a very minor, somewhat ghostly\
      \ role in this poem, which is a deliberate and violent contrast, so violent,\
      \ indeed, that the poem was rejected by The New Yorker [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q217305]\
      \ on the grounds that the contrast was much too violent for their taste. Between\
      \ an execution, which is in fact a conflation I've made myself of several executions\
      \ that took place in England [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21] during the\
      \ Renaissance [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4692], and an execution that took\
      \ place in the Buchenwald concentration camp [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q152802]\
      \ during the Second World War [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q362], and the\
      \ details of which I got from a book by Eugene Kogan, who was himself a prisoner\
      \ there for five years and survived, miraculously, and was then flown to England\
      \ to help draw up the indictments that were used, [coughs], excuse me, at the\
      \ Nuremberg Trials [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q80130]. Goethe's role, his\
      \ ghostly role in this, is explained by the fact that most prisoners who were\
      \ brought to Buchenwald were brought by train, and there was no railroad station\
      \ there at the camp, so the prisoners were, disembarked at the nearest railroad\
      \ station, which was Weimar [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3955], and they\
      \ walked the rest of the way from there. \n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:12:01\nReads\
      \ \"More Light! More Light!\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:14:36\n\
      The next is a little lighter, gratefully. But it has its gruesome aspects too,\
      \ as a matter of fact. It is called \"The Man Who Married Magdalen: Variation\
      \ on a Theme by Louis Simpson\". Louis Simpson [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1871997],\
      \ a fine poet and very old friend of mine. A road poem in one of his early books,\
      \ called \"The Man Who Married Magdalen\", a fine and delicate poem, in which\
      \ he imagines that this man who raged and stormed throughout his married life,\
      \ upon the death of his wife finds it in his heart to forgive her and to acknowledge\
      \ his abiding love for her. In fact, if I can remember the last stanza, it goes,\
      \ \"But when he woke, and woke alone, he wept and would deny the loose behaviour\
      \ of the bone, and the immodest thigh\". I have chosen to make him far less\
      \ forgiving in my version. He is a very angry man, and the whole poem takes\
      \ place in a bar where he has been releasing his anger in a bibulous way for\
      \ some time. His anger is not only personal, however, it's also theological.\
      \ He is someone who believes in and accepts the ancient dispensation according\
      \ to which Mary Magdalene [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q63070] had done something\
      \ which could not, in fact, be so easily forgiven. And he regards the new dispensation\
      \ as an antinomian heresy which leaves him bewildered and accounts for the rather\
      \ promiscuous behaviour he finds all around him in the bar. I ought to tell\
      \ you also that I went on a reading tour of New England [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q18389]\
      \ a few years ago, and I planned to include this, but when I got to...it has\
      \ some frankly dirty language in the second stanza, and I decided that it was\
      \ unbecoming at certain colleges, [audience laughter], but I was assured by\
      \ a friend of mine on the faculty at Wellesley [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49205]\
      \ that the girls there were tough, and they could take it.  [Audience laughter].\
      \ He liked it, and he thought I should read it. And indeed, I did. And nobody\
      \ batted an eye. So, from then on, without compunction at all, I read it everywhere\
      \ else, and when I got to Mount Hollyhock, [audience laughter], there I had\
      \ every intention of reading it, but they were not only taping it, as you are\
      \ here this evening, but they were taping it for radio broadcast, so I felt\
      \ obliged to warn the Federal Communications Commission [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q128831]\
      \ [audience laughter] that this was the sort of thing that they would probably\
      \ have to excise. And after the tour was over, I got a postcard from a friend\
      \ of mine in that bastion of propriety, Boston [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q100],\
      \ saying that he had heard the whole broadcast with nothing cut out, so I take\
      \ it there's absolutely nothing wrong with it now [audience laughter]. It has,\
      \ in any case, a lofty epigraph from the Book of Jonah [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q178819]\
      \ [audience laughter], which says, \"Then said the Lord, 'Dost thou well, to\
      \ be angry?'\u201D\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:17:57\nReads \"The Man Who Married\
      \ Magdalen: Variation on a Theme by Louis Simpson\" from The Hard Hours [audience\
      \ laughter throughout].\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:20:26\nA poem of a somewhat different\
      \ sort, called \"Message from the City\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:20:37\nReads\
      \ \"Message from the City\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:23:02\n\
      The poem I want to read next is also, again, on the somewhat grim side. It is,\
      \ in fact, incomplete, but it stands altogether, by itself. It's going to be\
      \ longer, but it is a unit, as it appears, or as I shall read it to you, and\
      \ it's called, in its present state, \"The Rune\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:23:35\n\
      Reads \"The Rune\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:27:54\nI guess\
      \ a really violent change of pace is required, and I can provide it. But you\
      \ are not to be spared as easily as that. There's another sort of wracking one\
      \ that comes up in a minute. However, I can interject something in between.\
      \ There's a little sort of period piece, a Restoration comedy song, sort of,\
      \ called \"The Song of the Flea\". It was written...there were a group of poems\
      \ that I wrote in collaboration with an artist. We did a bestiary together,\
      \ and he did a whole bunch of very handsome lithographs of animals, and I wrote\
      \ a few animal poems, and this is one of them.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:28:45\n\
      Reads \"The Song of the Flea\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:29:40\n\
      Now this, this next, is quite frankly a stinker, I've got to warn you. It's\
      \ a very unnerving poem. It's a colloquy; there are two voices, but I'm sure\
      \ you'll have no difficulty telling them apart. There is one speaker who is\
      \ a kind of compulsive talker, and he has a very patient and somewhat helpless\
      \ auditor. The poem is called \"Behold the Lilies of the Field\".\n \nAnthony\
      \ Hecht\n00:30:18\nReads \"Behold the Lilies of the Field\" from The Hard Hours.\n\
      \ \nAnthony Hecht\n00:34:34\nThe next is a blessed relief. It's called \"Jason\"\
      , which is the name of my older son, and it's a poem written to celebrate his\
      \ birth. He was born at the time I was teaching at Smith, and he was born on\
      \ a Sunday, which has some bearing on the poem, but it conveniently avoided\
      \ my, disrupting my academic obligations. And it has an epigraph from Doctor\
      \ Faustus [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q50919], which goes, \"And from America,\
      \ the Golden Fleece\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:35:16\nReads \"Jason\" from The\
      \ Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:37:12\nThe next one is also, this is also\
      \ rather cheery too--well, not really. I told you that I had gone on this New\
      \ England tour a few years ago, and I began it in Maine [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q724].\
      \ Well, I may have been misled [distortion], but I was told at the two or three\
      \ colleges and universities where I read that Maine was a dry state, and I had\
      \ so arranged my poems, completely unconsciously, that I had a whole bunch of\
      \ them that all took place in bars, in bars altogether [audience laughter].\
      \ So I had the feeling as I was reading--I couldn't stop, you see, there I was--\
      \ after the third poem, I felt that I appeared to be an obsessive alcoholic.\
      \ [Audience laughter]. This also takes place in a bar. I was born and brought\
      \ up in New York City, and remember it from the time when Third Avenue had an\
      \ elevator train that ran down its length. Now, that has all been torn down.\
      \ But in the old days, not only did it have the elevator train, but it was lined\
      \ on both sides all the way up and down with bars. The bars are still there.\
      \ But the advantage of the El was that it cast a nice, gloomy shadow over the\
      \ whole avenue even on the brightest days, so that you weren't obliged to face\
      \ utter reality as soon as you stepped outside [audience laughter]. There was\
      \ a sort of modulating gloom that you got out into. Now that's been torn down,\
      \ and it's tougher than it was. The poem is called \"Third Avenue in Sunlight\"\
      .\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:38:45\nReads \"Third Avenue in Sunlight\" from The Hard\
      \ Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:40:31\nThere are two more poems I should like\
      \ to read. The first of these is called \"Birdwatchers of America\". It has\
      \ an epigraph from the journals of Baudelaire [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q501],\
      \ very near the end of his life. Baudelaire wrote as follows: \"I suffer now\
      \ continually from vertigo, and today, the 23rd of January, 1862, I received\
      \ a singular warning. I felt the wind of the wing of madness pass over me\"\
      .\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:41:14\nReads \"Birdwatchers of America\" from The Hard\
      \ Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:42:50\nThis is called \"The End of the Weekend\"\
      .\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:42:56\nReads \"The End of the Weekend\" from The Hard\
      \ Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:44:38\nFinally, there is a poem that I must remind\
      \ you of which I enormously admire, by Matthew Arnold [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q271032].\
      \ \"Dover Beach\" [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5302469]. I have, in spite\
      \ of my admiration for it, ventured to write a somewhat impertinent commentary\
      \ upon it, which is called \"The Dover Bitch\" and subtitled [audience laughter],\
      \ \"A Criticism of Life\", which is what Arnold said poetry ought to be. \n\
      \ \nAnthony Hecht\n00:45:13\nReads \"The Dover Bitch: A Criticism of Life\"\
      \ from The Hard Hours [audience laughter throughout].\n \nEND\n00:46:55\n[Cut\
      \ off abruptly]."
    notes: Anthony Hecht reads from his book The Hard Hours which was published later
      in 1967 by Atheneum Press.

    notes: "American poet Anthony Hecht was born in New York City on January 16th,\
      \ 1923. Hecht has admitted that it was only in his freshman year at Bard College\
      \ that he became interested in poetry. Upon graduating from Bard in 1944, he\
      \ was drafted into the United States Army and served in Western Europe and Japan.\
      \ Hecht was especially impacted by the release of Jews in the concentration\
      \ camps, a subject that is echoed throughout his poetry. On his return, Hecht\
      \ was convinced to study with John Crowe Ransom at Kenyon College, and Ransom\
      \ became a major influence in Hecht\u2019s poetic and intellectual formation.\
      \ Hecht\u2019s poetry was first published in magazines like the Hudson Review,\
      \ the Kenyon Review and the New Yorker, and in 1950 he won the Prix de Rome\
      \ bestowed by the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Hecht\u2019s first book,\
      \ A Summoning of Stones (MacMillan, 1954) was published, along with a limited\
      \ edition pamphlet named The Seven Deadly Sins (Gehenna Press, 1954). Hecht\
      \ then taught at Smith College in Northampton from 1956 to 1959, and then at\
      \ Bard College from 1961 until 1967. It was at this point that Hecht began to\
      \ travel on reading tours of his poetry. His next publication, Jiggery Pokery:\
      \ A Compendium of Double Dactyls (Atheneum, 1966), with John Hollander and Milton\
      \ Glaser, compiled a new light verse form called \u2018double-dactyl\u2019,\
      \ which they had invented. A year later, Hecht released his second collection\
      \ of verse, The Hard Hours (Atheneum, 1967), and took a position at the University\
      \ of Rochester. In the next few years, Hecht translated Aeschylus\u2019 tragedy\
      \ of war, Seven Against Thebes (Oxford University Press, 1973) with Helen Bacon.\
      \ He was also the visiting professor at Washington University (1971), Harvard\
      \ (1973), and at Yale (1977). Hecht then published collections of poetry, Millions\
      \ of Strange Shadows (Atheneum, 1977) and The Venetian Vespers (Atheneum, 1979),\
      \ a collection of criticism, Obbligati (Atheneum, 1986), The Transparent Man\
      \ (Knopf, 1990) and Flight Among the Tombs (Knopf, 1990). Hecht retired in the\
      \ early 1990s from his post at Rochester, but remained active and published\
      \ Hidden Law (1993), a book-length study of Auden\u2019s poetry, and provided\
      \ the introduction to \u201CThe New Cambridge Shakespeare Sonnets\u201D in 1996.\
      \ Hecht was the first American poet to be invited to lecture at the Mellon Lectures\
      \ at the National Gallery of Art in 1992. Hecht published his last collection\
      \ of poetry, The Darkness and the Light (Knopf) in 2001. Anthony Hecht died\
      \ of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma on October 20, 2004."

      \ Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Anthony Hecht. \n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:01:36\nThank\
      \ you very much. It's a pleasure to be here, this is my first trip to Canada\
      \ [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16], and I regret that it should be so brief.\
      \ I must leave tomorrow, but I'm struck by the frigidity of the weather and\
      \ the warmth of the greeting that I received upon arriving. I'd like to begin\
      \ with a poem which I'll, is set in Italy [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q38],\
      \ where I spent quite a while. It's called \"A Hill\", and it's what...about\
      \ a purported visionary experience. \n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:02:21\nReads \"A\
      \ Hill\" from The Hard Hours..\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:04:50\nThe next is called\
      \ \"A Letter\". Some of these, I think, will require some sort of explanatory\
      \ comment from me, but I don't think this will. \n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:04:59\n\
      Reads \"A Letter\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:06:44\nThe next\
      \ is called \"The Vow\". I should say that all the poems that I want to read\
      \ to you this evening are from a book called The Hard Hours. They...the book\
      \ is, I fear, for better or for worse, somewhat on the grim side, as the title\
      \ is meant to indicate. It perhaps is a corrective to the abundant cheerfulness\
      \ of my first book. But I hope that there were a few light moments here and\
      \ there. This one, on the other--is somewhat grim. It is in fact about a miscarriage.\
      \ And I had better explain to you that a large part of the second stanza, and\
      \ all of the third stanza is spoken by the ghost of the child who fails to be\
      \ born. It is called \"The Vow\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:07:42\nReads \"The Vow\"\
      \ from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:10:01\nThe next one is also somewhat\
      \ on the grim side, but it requires an appeasing little note of explanation.\
      \ Its title is \"More Light! More Light!\" which purport to be the last words\
      \ of Goethe [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5879] on his deathbed. There's been\
      \ a good deal of discussion and dispute as to quite what he meant at the time,\
      \ which may simply have been to raise the shade. But inasmuch as he is regarded\
      \ as the spirit of the German Enlightenment, a great deal more profound significance\
      \ is normally attached to those words. He plays a very minor, somewhat ghostly\
      \ role in this poem, which is a deliberate and violent contrast, so violent,\
      \ indeed, that the poem was rejected by The New Yorker [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q217305]\
      \ on the grounds that the contrast was much too violent for their taste. Between\
      \ an execution, which is in fact a conflation I've made myself of several executions\
      \ that took place in England [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21] during the\
      \ Renaissance [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4692], and an execution that took\
      \ place in the Buchenwald concentration camp [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q152802]\
      \ during the Second World War [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q362], and the\
      \ details of which I got from a book by Eugene Kogan, who was himself a prisoner\
      \ there for five years and survived, miraculously, and was then flown to England\
      \ to help draw up the indictments that were used, [coughs], excuse me, at the\
      \ Nuremberg Trials [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q80130]. Goethe's role, his\
      \ ghostly role in this, is explained by the fact that most prisoners who were\
      \ brought to Buchenwald were brought by train, and there was no railroad station\
      \ there at the camp, so the prisoners were, disembarked at the nearest railroad\
      \ station, which was Weimar [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3955], and they\
      \ walked the rest of the way from there. \n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:12:01\nReads\
      \ \"More Light! More Light!\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:14:36\n\
      The next is a little lighter, gratefully. But it has its gruesome aspects too,\
      \ as a matter of fact. It is called \"The Man Who Married Magdalen: Variation\
      \ on a Theme by Louis Simpson\". Louis Simpson [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1871997],\
      \ a fine poet and very old friend of mine. A road poem in one of his early books,\
      \ called \"The Man Who Married Magdalen\", a fine and delicate poem, in which\
      \ he imagines that this man who raged and stormed throughout his married life,\
      \ upon the death of his wife finds it in his heart to forgive her and to acknowledge\
      \ his abiding love for her. In fact, if I can remember the last stanza, it goes,\
      \ \"But when he woke, and woke alone, he wept and would deny the loose behaviour\
      \ of the bone, and the immodest thigh\". I have chosen to make him far less\
      \ forgiving in my version. He is a very angry man, and the whole poem takes\
      \ place in a bar where he has been releasing his anger in a bibulous way for\
      \ some time. His anger is not only personal, however, it's also theological.\
      \ He is someone who believes in and accepts the ancient dispensation according\

      \ in any case, a lofty epigraph from the Book of Jonah [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q178819]\
      \ [audience laughter], which says, \"Then said the Lord, 'Dost thou well, to\
      \ be angry?'\u201D\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:17:57\nReads \"The Man Who Married\
      \ Magdalen: Variation on a Theme by Louis Simpson\" from The Hard Hours [audience\
      \ laughter throughout].\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:20:26\nA poem of a somewhat different\
      \ sort, called \"Message from the City\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:20:37\nReads\
      \ \"Message from the City\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:23:02\n\
      The poem I want to read next is also, again, on the somewhat grim side. It is,\
      \ in fact, incomplete, but it stands altogether, by itself. It's going to be\
      \ longer, but it is a unit, as it appears, or as I shall read it to you, and\
      \ it's called, in its present state, \"The Rune\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:23:35\n\
      Reads \"The Rune\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:27:54\nI guess\
      \ a really violent change of pace is required, and I can provide it. But you\
      \ are not to be spared as easily as that. There's another sort of wracking one\
      \ that comes up in a minute. However, I can interject something in between.\
      \ There's a little sort of period piece, a Restoration comedy song, sort of,\
      \ called \"The Song of the Flea\". It was written...there were a group of poems\
      \ that I wrote in collaboration with an artist. We did a bestiary together,\
      \ and he did a whole bunch of very handsome lithographs of animals, and I wrote\
      \ a few animal poems, and this is one of them.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:28:45\n\
      Reads \"The Song of the Flea\" from The Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:29:40\n\
      Now this, this next, is quite frankly a stinker, I've got to warn you. It's\
      \ a very unnerving poem. It's a colloquy; there are two voices, but I'm sure\
      \ you'll have no difficulty telling them apart. There is one speaker who is\
      \ a kind of compulsive talker, and he has a very patient and somewhat helpless\
      \ auditor. The poem is called \"Behold the Lilies of the Field\".\n \nAnthony\
      \ Hecht\n00:30:18\nReads \"Behold the Lilies of the Field\" from The Hard Hours.\n\
      \ \nAnthony Hecht\n00:34:34\nThe next is a blessed relief. It's called \"Jason\"\
      , which is the name of my older son, and it's a poem written to celebrate his\
      \ birth. He was born at the time I was teaching at Smith, and he was born on\
      \ a Sunday, which has some bearing on the poem, but it conveniently avoided\
      \ my, disrupting my academic obligations. And it has an epigraph from Doctor\
      \ Faustus [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q50919], which goes, \"And from America,\
      \ the Golden Fleece\".\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:35:16\nReads \"Jason\" from The\
      \ Hard Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:37:12\nThe next one is also, this is also\
      \ rather cheery too--well, not really. I told you that I had gone on this New\
      \ England tour a few years ago, and I began it in Maine [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q724].\
      \ Well, I may have been misled [distortion], but I was told at the two or three\
      \ colleges and universities where I read that Maine was a dry state, and I had\
      \ so arranged my poems, completely unconsciously, that I had a whole bunch of\
      \ them that all took place in bars, in bars altogether [audience laughter].\
      \ So I had the feeling as I was reading--I couldn't stop, you see, there I was--\
      \ after the third poem, I felt that I appeared to be an obsessive alcoholic.\
      \ [Audience laughter]. This also takes place in a bar. I was born and brought\
      \ up in New York City, and remember it from the time when Third Avenue had an\
      \ elevator train that ran down its length. Now, that has all been torn down.\
      \ But in the old days, not only did it have the elevator train, but it was lined\
      \ on both sides all the way up and down with bars. The bars are still there.\
      \ But the advantage of the El was that it cast a nice, gloomy shadow over the\
      \ whole avenue even on the brightest days, so that you weren't obliged to face\
      \ utter reality as soon as you stepped outside [audience laughter]. There was\
      \ a sort of modulating gloom that you got out into. Now that's been torn down,\
      \ and it's tougher than it was. The poem is called \"Third Avenue in Sunlight\"\
      .\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:38:45\nReads \"Third Avenue in Sunlight\" from The Hard\
      \ Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:40:31\nThere are two more poems I should like\
      \ to read. The first of these is called \"Birdwatchers of America\". It has\
      \ an epigraph from the journals of Baudelaire [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q501],\
      \ very near the end of his life. Baudelaire wrote as follows: \"I suffer now\
      \ continually from vertigo, and today, the 23rd of January, 1862, I received\
      \ a singular warning. I felt the wind of the wing of madness pass over me\"\
      .\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:41:14\nReads \"Birdwatchers of America\" from The Hard\
      \ Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:42:50\nThis is called \"The End of the Weekend\"\
      .\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:42:56\nReads \"The End of the Weekend\" from The Hard\
      \ Hours.\n \nAnthony Hecht\n00:44:38\nFinally, there is a poem that I must remind\
      \ you of which I enormously admire, by Matthew Arnold [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q271032].\
      \ \"Dover Beach\" [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5302469]. I have, in spite\
      \ of my admiration for it, ventured to write a somewhat impertinent commentary\
      \ upon it, which is called \"The Dover Bitch\" and subtitled [audience laughter],\
      \ \"A Criticism of Life\", which is what Arnold said poetry ought to be. \n\
      \ \nAnthony Hecht\n00:45:13\nReads \"The Dover Bitch: A Criticism of Life\"\
      \ from The Hard Hours [audience laughter throughout].\n \nEND\n00:46:55\n[Cut\
      \ off abruptly]."
